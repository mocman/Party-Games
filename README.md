Duel a friend in actor association trivia.

This is a SwiftUI project that pulls the top grossing movies and their actors from The Movie Database (API Key Required) and makes a game out of it.

Two players sit across from each other at a table with their phone on the table. The game displays a movie title, then cycles through a list of actor names that may or may not be associated with the movie. The ratio of correct to incorrect actors is 1:5.

Players may "buzz in" by tapping and holding the screen. Once held, the phone will provide haptic feedback and display a green or red background to let the player know they if they were correct. Once the player releases their hold, a new movie is displayed and a refreshed list of actors is cycled through. If the player was correct, their portion of the screen will grow, or shrink if they are incorrect. 

The game continues until a player has 100% of the screen.
